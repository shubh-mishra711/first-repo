# Contributing to documentation

Thanks for helping improve documentation! A short checklist to get started:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch (e.g. `docs/update-setup`)
2. Add or update a doc under `docs/`
3. Run any formatting or linters the project uses for docs
4. Open a pull request referencing this issue (#1)

Please follow project contribution guidelines and keep changes small and focused.
