# Architecture

This short page describes the repository layout and high-level design.

- `docs/` — project documentation and examples
- `src/` / `lib/` — (if present) the main source code
- `tests/` — (if present) test suites and CI configuration

Add diagrams, a detailed component breakdown, and pointers to notable modules when ready.
