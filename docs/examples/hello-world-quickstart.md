# Example: Hello World (Quickstart)

This technical quickstart demonstrates a small, self-contained example that shows how to run the core functionality of this repository. Replace commands and snippets with ones that match your project's language/runtime.

## Requirements
- Git
- Runtime/tooling for the project (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go — update as needed)

## Quickstart (example)
Create and run a minimal script to print a greeting and verify the environment.

### Example (bash + Node.js)
1. Create file:

```bash
cat > example.js <<'JS'
console.log('Hello from first-repo — quickstart example');
JS
```

2. Run it:

```bash
node example.js
```

Expected output:
```
Hello from first-repo — quickstart example
```

### Notes
- Replace the snippet above with a real minimal example that exercises your project's most important code path.
- Add tests verifying the example runs in CI if applicable.
